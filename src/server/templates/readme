### To re-import the snippet into Script Lab:
Copy the metadata (*.yaml) file into the "import" screen in Script Lab. See <https://github.com/OfficeDev/script-lab/blob/master/README.md#import> for detailed instructions.

### To run the snippet *outside* of Script Lab (like a "mini" exported {{{addinOrWebpage}}}):

{{#if isAddin}}
1. Publish the html file to a website. Note that because settings/cookies/etc are stored per domain name (not per page URL, but the entire domain name), it is best to put the snippet in its own website (with its own unique domain name) if you make use of these.

2. Search for `https://<INSERT-URL-HERE>` within manifest file (should be 2 occurrences), and replace both with the URL that the html page is published to. If you've renamed the html file, adjust the path as well.

3. Sideload the manifest using the instructions found at <https://aka.ms/sideload-addins>.
