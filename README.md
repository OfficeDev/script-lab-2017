## What is Script Lab?

Wouldn't it be crazy if you could launch Excel, click to open a small code window, and then instantly start writing and executing JavaScript that interacts with your spreadsheet?

Script lab is a tool for anyone who wants to learn about writing Office add-ins for Excel, Word, or PowerPoint. The focus is the Office JavaScript API, which is the technology you need for building Office Add-ins that run across platforms. Maybe you're an experienced Office developer and you want to quickly prototype a feature for your add-in. Or maybe you've never tried writing code for Office and you just want to play with a sample and tweak it to learn more. Either way, Script Lab is for you.
Script Lab has three main features:
* **Code** in a pane beside your spreadsheet. IntelliSense is there while you type so you can easily discover and use the Office JavaScript objects and methods. And if you don't want to start from scratch there are plenty of samples pre-installed with Script Lab. Your snippets can use any TypeScript features like arrow functions, template strings, and async/await (i.e., a good chunk of ES6 and ES7 features). But it's not only script: your snippets can also use HTML, CSS, and references to external libraries and data on the web. Script Lab uses the Monaco editor, the same tech that powers VS Code, so it's beautiful and lightweight.
* **Run** the code in another pane beside the edlitor. Execution can include logic, API calls to Office, UI in the pane, and even output to a console. Every time you make a code change you can refresh the editor and run the new version in seconds.
* **Share** your snippets through GitHub. If you create a snippet you'd like to share, you can use Script Lab to save it. Then send the link to someone else to try it and tweak it on their computer. The Import feature lets you load other people's snippets.

You can [install Script Lab right now for free from the Office Store](https://store.office.com/app.aspx?assetid=WA104380862)! It works for Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and Project. You'll need Office 2013 or later, Office Online, or Office for Mac.

Script Lab is a Microsoft Garage project that began at a hackathon. You can read our story on the [Garage website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/project-details.aspx?project=script-lab)

Here's a 1-minute teaser video to give you a taste:

<a id="get-started"></a>
## Get Started

The easiest way to try Script Lab is with the Tutorial file for Excel that walks you through the tool in a few steps. You can get it here on GitHub: [script-lab-tutorial.xlsx](https://github.com/OfficeDev/script-lab/blob/master/src/client/assets/documents/script-lab-tutorial.xlsx)

Alternatively, you can start from scratch and [install Script Lab from the Store](https://store.office.com/app.aspx?assetid=WA104380862).

This 10-minute demo explains how to use the main features:

<a id="import"></a>
## Import someone else's snippet, or export your own

Script Lab is built around sharing.  If someone gives you a URL to a GitHub GIST, simply open Script Lab, use the hamburger menu at the top left to see the menu, and choose "Import" category (either on the left or top, depending on the available screen space). Then, enter the URL of the GIST, and click the "Import" button at the bottom of the screen.  In just these few clicks, you will be able to view and run someone else's snippet!

Conversely, to share *your* snippet with someone, choose the "Share" menu within a particular snippet. You can share as a public or private [GitHub Gist](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/), or you can copy the entire snippet metadata to the clipboard, and share it from there.

<a id="report-bug"></a>
## Report a bug, or suggest a feature

To report a bug, [create a new issue](https://github.com/OfficeDev/script-lab/issues/new). Please provide as much detail as you can: tell us the operating system, the Office build number, and your browser (if you're using Office Online).

It can also help to provide your Script Lab User ID (we generate it randomly for each device and it stays assigned to you until you clear your browser cache). You can find this ID under the **About** section in the editor view:

![About -> User ID](.github/images/screenshot-about-user-id.jpg)

If you have a suggestion for a feature, please feel free to file it under "issues" as well, and we will tag it appropriately.  The more detail, the better!  We also gladly accept pull requests... (see more at [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)).

Finally, if you have a **question**, please ask it on <https://stackoverflow.com> instead. Tag your questions with `office-js` and `scriptlab`.

## Use Script Lab with older Office versions (Office 2013)
Office 2013 has several limitations compared to more recent versions.

First, there are far fewer supported objects and methods in the JavaScript API for Office 2013. As a result, many snippets that work on later versions of Office will not run in Office 2013. In the **Samples** menu we have included certain samples specifically designed to use only capabilities that are available in Office 2013. Those samples are marked **(2013)** in the sample title.

Second, Office 2013 (and Office 2016 RTM, if you don't have an Office 365 subscription) does not support ribbon buttons for Script Lab. As a result, there's a different way to access the **Code** and **Run** functions:
* To **Code**, select the **INSERT** tab and choose **My Add-ins**, then insert Script Lab.
* To **Run** a snippet, click the small **Run** triangle icon at the top of the Script Lab code pane.
