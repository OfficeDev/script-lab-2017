Experiment with the Office JavaScript API without ever leaving Excel, Word, or PowerPoint! You can use Script Lab to:
• Create and edit code snippets that can include JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and references to libraries and data on the web
• Run the snippets and instantly see the result in a task pane and in the Office document
• Get started quickly with a selection of samples
• Share and save your snippets with GitHub gists
• Learn the JavaScript API with the help of IntelliSense while you edit
• Try TypeScript: make use of arrow functions, template strings, or even the latest TypeScript 2.0+ features like async/await
• Prototype an add-in you're planning to develop

There's no need to install any other software or configure your environment: as long as you have Office, you can get started in seconds.

Script Lab, a Microsoft Garage project, works in Excel, Word, and PowerPoint (Office 2013 and later, Office Online, and Office for Mac).
